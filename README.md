# _Screenshots_

_Screenshots_ is a standalone command line utility and package for capturing screenshot images for Flutter.   

_Screenshots_ will start the required android emulators and iOS simulators (or find attached devices), run your screen capture tests on each emulator/simulator (or device), process the images, and drop them off to Fastlane for delivery to both stores.

It is inspired by three tools from Fastlane:  
1. [Snapshots](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/screenshots/)  
This is used to capture screenshots on iOS using iOS UI Tests.
1. [Screengrab](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/screengrab/)  
This captures screenshots on android using Android Espresso tests.
1. [FrameIt](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/frameit/)  
This is used to place captured iOS screenshots in a device frame.

Since all three of these Fastlane tools do not work with Flutter, _Screenshots_ combines key features of these Fastlane tools into one tool. 

# Features
Since Flutter integration testing is designed to work transparently across iOS and Android, capturing images using _Screenshots_ is easy.

Features include: 
1. Works with your existing tests  
Add a single line for each screenshot.
1. Run your tests on any device  
Select the devices you want to run on, using a convenient config file. _Screenshots_ will find the devices (real or emulated) and run your tests.
1. One run for both platforms  
_Screenshots_ runs your tests on both iOS and Android in one run.  
(as opposed to making separate Snapshots and Screengrab runs)
1. One run for multiple locales  
If your app supports multiple locales, _Screenshots_ will optionally set the locales listed in the config file before running each test.
1. One run for frames  
Optionally places images in device frames in same run.  
(as opposed to making separate FrameIt runs... which supports iOS only)
1. One run for clean status bars  
Every image that _Screenshots_ generates has a clean status bar.  
(no need to run a separate stage to clean-up status bars)
1. Works with Fastlane  
_Screenshots_ drops-off images where Fastlane expects to find them. Fastlane's [deliver](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/) and [supply](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/) can then be used to upload to respective stores.
1. Works with FrameIt  
Works with Fastlane's FrameIt [text and background](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/frameit/#text-and-background) feature to add text, etc... to a framed screenshot generated by `screenshots`.  
1. Works with any attached real devices  
Use any number of real devices to capture screenshots.

Additional automation features:  
1. _Screenshots_ runs in the cloud.  
For live demo of _Screenshots_ running with the internationalized [example](example) app on macOS in cloud, see [below](#sample-run-on-travis)    
1. _Screenshots_ works with any CI/CD tool.  
For live demo of uploading images, generated by _Screenshots_, to both store consoles, see demo of Fledge at https://github.com/mmcc007/fledge#demo

# Installation
On macOS:
````bash
$ brew update && brew install imagemagick
$ pub global activate screenshots
````
Note:  
If `pub` is not found, add to PATH using:  
```
export PATH="$PATH:<path to flutter installation directory>/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin"
```
# Usage

````
$ screenshots
````
Or, if using a config file other than the default 'screenshots.yaml':
````
$ screenshots -c <path to config file>
````
Other options:
```
$ screenshots -h
usage: screenshots [-h] [-c <config file>] [-m <normal|recording|comparison|archive>] [-f <flavor>]

sample usage: screenshots

-c, --config=<screenshots.yaml>                     Path to config file.
                                                    (defaults to "screenshots.yaml")

-m, --mode=<normal|recording|comparison|archive>    If mode is recording, screenshots will be saved for later comparison.
                                                    If mode is comparison, screenshots will be compared with recorded.
                                                    If mode is archive, screenshots will be archived (and cannot be uploaded via fastlane).
                                                    [normal (default), recording, comparison, archive]

-f, --flavor=<flavor name>                          Flavor name.
-h, --help                                          Display this help information.
```

# Modifying your tests for _Screenshots_
A special function is provided in the _Screenshots_ package that is called by the test each time you want to capture a screenshot. 
_Screenshots_ will then process the images appropriately during a _Screenshots_ run.

To capture screenshots in your tests:
1. Include the _Screenshots_ package in your pubspec.yaml's dev_dependencies section  
   ````yaml
     screenshots: ^<current version>
   ````
2. In your tests
    1. Import the dependencies  
       ````dart
       import 'package:screenshots/screenshots.dart';
       ````
    2. Create the config at start of test  
       ````dart
            final configInfo = Config().configInfo;
       ````  
    3. Throughout the test make calls to capture screenshots  
       ````dart
           await screenshot(driver, configInfo, 'myscreenshot1');
       ````
       
Note: make sure your screenshot names are unique across all your tests.

Note: to turn off the debug banner on your screens, in your integration test's main(), call:
````dart
  WidgetsApp.debugAllowBannerOverride = false; // remove debug banner for screenshots
````

## Modifying tests based on screenshots environment
In some cases it is useful to know what device, device type, screen size, screen orientation and locale you are currently testing with. To obtain this information in your test use:
```
final screenshotsEnv = config.screenshotsEnv;
```
See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31609 for related `flutter driver` issue.

# Configuration
_Screenshots_ uses a configuration file to configure a run.  
 The default config filename is `screenshots.yaml`:
````yaml
# A list of screen capture tests
# Note: flutter driver expects a pair of files eg, main1.dart and main1_test.dart
tests:
  - test_driver/main1.dart
  - test_driver/main2.dart

# Interim location of screenshots from tests
staging: /tmp/screenshots

# A list of locales supported by the app
locales:
  - en-US
  - de-DE

# A map of devices to emulate
devices:
  ios:
    iPhone XS Max:
      frame: false
    iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (3rd generation):
      orientation: LandscapeRight
  android:
    Nexus 6P:

# Frame screenshots
frame: true
````

## Device Parameters
Individual devices can be configured in `screenshots.yaml` by specifying per device parameters.

| Parameter | Values | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|frame|true/false|optional|Controls whether screenshots generated on the device should be placed in a frame. Overrides the global frame setting (see example `screenshots.yaml` above).
|orientation|Portrait \| LandscapeRight \| PortraitUpsideDown \| LandscapeLeft|optional|Controls orientation of device during test. Currently disables framing resulting in a raw screenshot. Ignored for real devices.


Note: images generated for those devices where framing is disabled are probably not suitable for upload, but can be used for local review.

Note: orientation on iOS simulators is implemented using an AppleScript script which requires granting permission on first use.

# Record/Compare Mode
_Screenshots_ can be used to monitor any unexpected changes to the UI by comparing the new screenshots to previously recorded screenshots. Any differences will be highlighted in a 'diff' image for review.  

To use this feature:
1. Add the location of your recording directory to a `screenshots.yaml`
    ```yaml
    recording: /tmp/screenshots_record
    ```
1. Run a recording to capture your screenshots:
    ```
    screenshots -m recording
    ```
1. Run subsequent _Screenshots_ with:
    ```
    screenshots -m comparison
    ```
    _Screenshots_ will compare the new screenshots with the recorded screenshots and generate a 'diff' image for each screenshot that does not compare. The diff image highlights the differences in red.

# Archive Mode
To generate screenshots for local use, such as generating reports of changes to UI over time, etc... use 'archive' mode. 

To enable this mode:
1. Add the location of your archive directory to screenshots.yaml:
    ```yaml
    archive: /tmp/screenshots_archive
    ```
1. Run _Screenshots_ with:
    ````
    $ screenshots -m archive
    ````

# Integration with Fastlane
Since _Screenshots_ is intended to be used with Fastlane, after _Screenshots_ completes, the images can be found in your project at:
````
android/fastlane/metadata/android
ios/fastlane/screenshots
````
Images are in a format suitable for upload via [deliver](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/) 
and [supply](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/).

Tip: One way to use _Screenshots_ with Fastlane is to call _Screenshots_ before calling Fastlane (or optionally call from Fastlane). Fastlane (for either iOS or Android) will then find the images in the appropriate place.  

(For a live demo of using Fastlane to upload screenshot images to both store consoles, see demo of Fledge at https://github.com/mmcc007/fledge#demo)

## Fastlane FrameIt
iOS images generated by _Screenshots_ can also be further processed using FrameIt's [text and background](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/frameit/#text-and-background) feature.

# Changing devices

To change the devices to run your tests on, just change the list of devices in screenshots.yaml.

Make sure each device you select has a supported screen and a
corresponding attached device or installed emulator/simulator. To bypass
the supported screen requirement use `frame: false` for each related device in your
screenshots.yaml.

For each selected device:
1. Confirm device is present in [screens.yaml](https://github.com/mmcc007/screenshots/blob/master/lib/resources/screens.yaml).  
2. Add device to the list of devices in screenshots.yaml.  
3. Confirm a real device is attached, or install an emulator/simulator for device.   

## Config validation
_Screenshots_ will check your configuration before running for any errors and provide a guide on how to resolve.

# Upgrading
To upgrade, simply re-issue the install command
````bash
$ pub global activate screenshots
````
Note: the _Screenshots_ version should be the same for both the command line and in your `pubspec.yaml`.   
1. If upgrading the command line version of _Screenshots_, also upgrade
 the version of _Screenshots_ in your pubspec.yaml.    
2. If upgrading the version of _Screenshots_ in your pubspec.yaml, also upgrade the command line version.

To check the version of _Screenshots_ currently installed:
```
pub global list
```
